\chapter{Introduction}
The Internet has revolutionized communication. The author would like to argue that this happened because it drastically lowered the cost of communication by removing interface barriers, unifying standards and organizations. Internet is cheap while legacy, purpose-made, communication networks are expensive (e.g. consider the PSTN\footnote{Public Switched Telephone Network, your ordinary phone}). These lowered costs allowed people to send and receive information at an enormous rate, creating new types of medias and services such as the blog, the social network, the search engine etc. Because of these benefits, we try to expand the Internet, and now strides are being made to connect the objects that we surround ourselves with, creating what's commonly called he `Internet of Things' (abbreviated as IoT). It's a vision of an extended Internet where household objects (radiators, lighting etc), sensors and actuators in industrial machinery, cars etc are put `online'. Data is primarily sent and received by radio as cables are expensive to install and maintain.

The underlying motivation as to why we want to communicate with things are that they and their surroundings matters to humans. A thing such as freezer can notify building management when its about to break down and notify building management before the food is spoiled. Data from the vibration sensor in the bridge helps the engineer to model its health and plan maintenance. A thing can also help another thing, e.g. the temperature sensor telling the radiator to turn as the temperature is falling.

% This is of importance to humans as its believed that the IoT will greatly reduce the cost for communication thing to thing and man to thing. This enables more information to be shared, and more information usually translates into a better understanding of the environment, which translates into a more efficient world. An example of this would be an Internet-connected temperature sensor in a room which gives the IoT-enabled radiators a better idea about when and how much heat to apply.

Unlike a regular host on the Internet (e.g. a PC) an IoT device is often purpose-made for a few single tasks (e.g. measuring the temperature in the example above). Data is usually sent and received over radio. This allows the computer's electronics to be small, cheap and consume little power, so little that it can be run of a non-rechargeable battery for the system's entire lifetime. This set of technological characteristics are what commonly characterize the IoT.

%The promise of cheap, ubiquitous and easily installable computers bundled with the Internet's ease of communication is what fuels the vision of an Internet of Things.

Contiki is small and resource efficient operating system that tries to address the above requirements. With only 35 kB of ROM and 8 kB RAM it provides an IP stack as well as multitasking. On the multitude of platforms officially supported, the hardware is often composed of a small 16-bit CPU, a small non-rechargeable battery and a radio operating in the 2.4 GHz ISM band FIXCORRECT. Developed mainly at SICS, the OS have gathered a large following around the world, only surpassed by its relative TinyOS. Naturally, Contiki is the primary research platform for IoT at SICS, and is why the work of this thesis is based upon it.


%Although this allows communication with the rest of the Internet, it cannot be done in privacy. Any host in the path of a message between it and any other host can read, stop or manipulate the data. This is problematic if the IoT device measures or controls something deemed important to humans, such as a door lock or a motion sensor in a burglar alarm. Therefore the author have investigated whether or no it's feasible to implement support for an Internet standard that enables hosts to communicate securely over the Internet; IPsec. IPsec is an IETF\footnote{Internet Engineering Task Force} standard that is a part of IPv6, the coming replacement to the current IP protocol. This thesis outlines its design, implementation and evaluation of this standard and its utility in the Contiki OS.



%  For example;  As the hosts (computers) usually are located inside, or in the direct vicinity of the object of interest,    power is usually supplied by a small non-rechargeable battery and communicates by radio.\\
% \\
%  This implies that said devices must be able to use the same protocols and standards as the rest of the Internet. One such piece is the suite of security features offered by the IP protocol, called IPsec.\\
% \\
% Contiki is an OS for devices running on the Internet of Things. It features an implementation of the IP protocol and several other Internet standards. The purpose of this work is to add yet another standard to it; IPsec. IPsec is an extension to the IP protocol that enables hosts to communicate securely over the Internet. Naturally, there are several implementations of IPsec readily avaible, but we can't use them since they don't fit. IoT devices that runs Contiki are usually very constrained in memory as well as CPU, but above all, energy is most important. The typical IoT -device is battery powered. Because of this, the result of the work must be able to save resources whereever possible, 

\section{Problem statement}
As the IoT will control and monitor sensors as well as machines in our surroundings, security is a natural concern. Any device in the network can send For example, consider the case of the door lock that is connected to the Internet via IoT. Anyone device which  When it receives a message telling it to unlock it wants to assert the identity of the sender, know 

% The goal of this thesis is the investigate the feasibility of using IPsec in the Contiki operating system. This implies that the software implementing the standard should not only fit on the device's limited ROM memory, but be demonstrated to actually do something useful.

The source code was managed using the Git source code revisioning system. Development was organized in such a way that the project was run in one branch\footnote{Git branches are similar in concept to those in other SCMS. ...} (hereafter called \emph{develop}) parallell to Contiki's master branch. Important patches / changes that occurred in Contiki while the development was underway chould thus simply be fetched / merged into \emph{develop}.

\section{IoT}

SICS\footnote{Swedish Institute of Computer Science} have been conducting research the field of IoT for over a decade. The purpose is to explore, and try to solve, the problems in the software stack. One of these areas is end-to-end security between a host in the IoT network and one on the Internet.

 This has resulted in the very small event driven operating system Contiki. 

Why we want IoT.
In order to bring IoT out of the lab and into the society it needs to be secure. A pair of hosts in the network must be able to authenticate each other and protect their communication from privy eyes by means of encryption. The solution concerned also needs to be standards-compliant with the rest of the Internet.

This suggests that TLS or IPsec may be suitable.

TLS secures a TCP connection. IPsec secures everything from the network layer and up. The purpose of this work is to implement IPsec and IKEv2 

The topic of this work is to implement IPsec and IKEv2 with the purpose of investigating the following:

\section{Scope}

The purpose of this thesis is to explore the IPsec venue; is it a feasible solution?

\subsection{Motivation}

The goal of the thesis is to write an implementation of IPsec and IKEv2 in order to prove that the following is possible:
* Low power, resource constrained hardware can utilize ``heavy'' Internet-standards and asymmetric encryption
* The implementation should be able to communicate with a wide range of systems

From this, the following should be required in order to form a valid proof-of-concept:
* The implementation should be polite towards other hosts. It should be able to handle a wide range of situations.
* Where time does not allow for a full implementation of a certain functionality, it should be clear that the implementation can be extended without significant rewrites of other parts.

The original scope was the implementation of the IKEv2 service as described in RFC 5996 [...] for the Contiki OS. After a more thourough investigation this was found not to be feasible.
