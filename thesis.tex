\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:intro}
The Internet has revolutionized communication. I would like to argue that this happened because it drastically lowered the cost of communication by removing interface barriers, unifying standards and organizations. Internet is cheap while legacy, purpose-made, communication networks are expensive (e.g. consider the PSTN\footnote{Public Switched Telephone Network, the ordinary telephone network}). These lowered costs allowed people to send and receive information at an enormous rate, creating new types of medias and services such as the blog, the social network, the search engine etc. Because of these benefits, we try to expand the Internet, and now strides are being made to connect the objects that we surround ourselves with, creating what's commonly called he `Internet of Things' (abbreviated as IoT). It's a vision of an extended Internet where household objects (radiators, lighting etc), sensors and actuators in industrial machinery, cars etc are put `online'. Data is primarily sent and received by radio as cables are expensive to install and maintain.

The underlying motivation as to why we want to communicate with things are that they and their surroundings matters to humans. A thing such as freezer can notify building management when its about to break down and notify building management before the food is spoiled. Data from the vibration sensor in the bridge helps the engineer to model its health and plan maintenance. A thing can also help another thing, e.g. the temperature sensor telling the radiator to turn as the temperature is falling.

% This is of importance to humans as its believed that the IoT will greatly reduce the cost for communication thing to thing and man to thing. This enables more information to be shared, and more information usually translates into a better understanding of the environment, which translates into a more efficient world. An example of this would be an Internet-connected temperature sensor in a room which gives the IoT-enabled radiators a better idea about when and how much heat to apply.

Unlike a regular host on the Internet (e.g. a PC) an IoT device is often purpose-made for a few single tasks (e.g. measuring the temperature in the example above). Data is usually sent and received over radio. This allows the computer's electronics to be small, cheap and consume little power, so little that it can be run of a non-rechargeable battery for the system's entire lifetime. This set of technological characteristics are what commonly characterize the IoT.

%The promise of cheap, ubiquitous and easily installable computers bundled with the Internet's ease of communication is what fuels the vision of an Internet of Things.

Contiki is small and resource efficient operating system that tries to address the above requirements. With only 35 kB of ROM and 8 kB RAM it provides an IP stack as well as multitasking. On the multitude of platforms officially supported, the hardware is often composed of a small 16-bit CPU, a small non-rechargeable battery and a radio operating in the 2.4 GHz ISM band FIXCORRECT. Developed mainly at SICS, the OS have gathered a large following around the world, only surpassed by its relative TinyOS. Naturally, Contiki is the primary research platform for IoT at SICS, and is why the work of this thesis is based upon it.

As the IoT will control and monitor sensors as well as machines in our surroundings, security is a natural concern. Internet (more specifically, the IP protocol) by itself does not offer any security guarantees by default. This is especially true in the IoT world where the physical layer often is provided by radio. Therefore, this thesis will explore the possibilities of implementing the IPsec security extension of the IP-protocol in the Contiki OS. This will bring methods to secure communications to the IoT, that are also compatible with vast parts of the Internet.


%Although this allows communication with the rest of the Internet, it cannot be done in privacy. Any host in the path of a message between it and any other host can read, stop or manipulate the data. This is problematic if the IoT device measures or controls something deemed important to humans, such as a door lock or a motion sensor in a burglar alarm. Therefore I have investigated whether or no it's feasible to implement support for an Internet standard that enables hosts to communicate securely over the Internet; IPsec. IPsec is an IETF\footnote{Internet Engineering Task Force} standard that is a part of IPv6, the coming replacement to the current IP protocol. This thesis outlines its design, implementation and evaluation of this standard and its utility in the Contiki OS.



%  For example;  As the hosts (computers) usually are located inside, or in the direct vicinity of the object of interest,    power is usually supplied by a small non-rechargeable battery and communicates by radio.\\
% \\
%  This implies that said devices must be able to use the same protocols and standards as the rest of the Internet. One such piece is the suite of security features offered by the IP protocol, called IPsec.\\

% Contiki is an OS for devices running on the Internet of Things. It features an implementation of the IP protocol and several other Internet standards. The purpose of this work is to add yet another standard to it; IPsec. IPsec is an extension to the IP protocol that enables hosts to communicate securely over the Internet. Naturally, there are several implementations of IPsec readily avaible, but we can't use them since they don't fit. IoT devices that runs Contiki are usually very constrained in memory as well as CPU, but above all, energy is most important. The typical IoT -device is battery powered. Because of this, the result of the work must be able to save resources whereever possible, 

\section{Problem statement}
As the IoT will control and monitor sensors as well as machines in our surroundings, security is a natural concern. Internet (more specifically, the IP protocol) by itself does not offer any security guarantees by default. This is especially true in the IoT world where the physical layer often is provided by radio. Any device with suitable radio equipment can read IP-packets destined for others, create and send packets while imposing as another host and manipulate data in transmissions destined for somebody else. This is problematic if the IoT device measures or controls something deemed important to humans, such as a door lock or a motion sensor in a burglar alarm. When receiving a message in the case of the former, the host controlling the door lock wants to assert that: the identity of sender is correct; that the message have not been tampered with; and preferably, it should be encrypted so that no other host except the addressee can read it. At the same time, the technology enabling this must be supported by the lock (the IoT device) and the other host, which might be any type of machine anywhere on the Internet. IPsec is one of many similar standards designed to solve these problems.

The difficulty of the work lies in making an implementation that is compatible with other hosts on the Internet (enabling communication), fulfilling the security requirements (correctness) while simultaneous assuring that the code is small enough to fit in the limited memory. This also relates to energy requirements, especially in the context of cryptography which is heavily used by IPsec, as computations consumes a sizable part of an IoT host's energy budget.

\section{Research question}
Can IPsec and IKEv2 be implemented within the current hardware boundaries while still being interoperable with other Internet hosts?
 
%There are several different solutions to these problems. One of them is IPsec, which is the standard that I have chosen to implement for the Contiki OS. The main hurdle

\section{Method}
Much of the research in IoT is carried out by experiments because of the highly applied nature of the field. Indeed, most of the Internet as-of-today, was constructed on the basis of principles surmised from experiments. Therefore, I decided to implement the various components that makes up a functional IPsec system and then test them. The tests were carried out by subjecting the system to common communication scenarios with other IPsec-enabled Internet hosts: handshaking a new secure connection; receiving and transmitting packets with various security policies applied; housekeeping of connections. The success or failure of the test is determined if it worked, or if it succeeded, how well it did so. Finally, memory consumption and cpu time is measured for the different tasks. It's the results of these tests that will form the basis of the evaluation of the 1) quality and workmanship of the implementation 2) suitability of IPsec for IoT in general.

\subsection{Development process}
The source code was managed using the Git source code revision system. Development was organized in such a way that the project was run in one branch\footnote{Git branches are similar in concept to those in other SCMS. ...} (hereafter called \emph{develop}) parallel to Contiki's master branch. Important patches / changes that occurred in Contiki while the development was underway could thus simply be fetched / merged into \emph{develop}. Patches in develop that proved  was then merged in from the 

\section{Limitations}
Firstly, the purpose of this work is to answer the questions raised in the problem statement, not to create an implementation that's ready for production use. Thus, parts of the standard that are not necessary to meet this end can be omitted. This also includes parts that are labeled as REQUIRED in the standard documents, as they're only necessary if you strive towards full compliance, which in terms of features arguably is superset of that of interoperability.

\section{Alternative Approaches}
There are many ways of securing communication in a computer network, far too many to review in this section. What follows is a swift review of the closest alternatives for security in IoT networks. A thorough review and comparison will be made of these in the discussion towards the end of this thesis.

The traditional approach in the IoT world has been to secure communication by using the IEEE's 802.11.4 link layer and its security features. There are also plenty of research articles outlining completely new security schemes, but none of these have made it into and IETF standard as far as I am aware. Another alternative is the IETF's TLS protocol\footnote{The TLS protocol is a successor to SSL} that operates next to the application layer, but no implementation of that has been completed as of today to the best of my knowledge.

A final possibility would be to come to a conclusion by using analysis. Supposing that the main obstacle to a functional solution is that of ROM, RAM, CPU speed and energy requirements. As one can assume the cryptographic libraries to consume the majority of the resources, one can arrive at an approximation for the hardware requirements by benchmarking them stand-alone. This would certainly help in arriving at an upper bound for the hardware requirements, but the analysis would not tell us anything about the operational problems and benefits that a complete implementation would.

%These can be ordered by the network layer\footnote{The notion of network layers is derived from the idealized OSI-model in which network protocols are ordered in a stack of seven layers.} at which they operate.

\section{Scientific Contributions}
This report makes three scientific contributions. The first is the demonstration of that it's feasible to implement IPsec with dynamic key management and IKEv2 in the Contiki OS. The second is that it's possible to simplify the IPsec protocol in IPv6-IoT environments without sacrificing much in interoperability. The final is that IPsec's network-centric policy language is ill suited for ad-hoc, self-organized network environments, such as that created by the RPL\footnote{The Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is an IETF standard (RFC 6553) that creates dynamic routing topologies} routing protocol commonly used in conjunction with IoT.

\section{Report Structure}
The purpose of the \prettyref{cha:intro} is to give the reader an overview of the report. The next chapter, \nameref{cha:bg}, will begin by a discussion of the problems that are particular to the field of IoT and how Contiki is constructed. This will be followed by a brief recount of the background and design of IPsec, followed by an introduction to automatic keying and the IKEv2 protocol. In \prettyref{cha:doi} I outline how the IPsec standard is adapted to IoT and Contiki. Simplifications and omissions of features are explained and argued for. The design is then evaluated in \nameref{cha:eval} by measuring parameters such as time, energy and memory usage when sending and receiving data. Space will also be given to observations of a qualitative nature, such as how well the standard integrates with the Contiki OS. My opinions of the evaluation and suggestions for future work is given in \nameref{cha:fw}.


\chapter{Background}
\label{cha:bg}
The purpose of this chapter is to introduce the reader to the Contiki OS and the IPsec standard. A good understanding of these systems are necessary to understand the latter \prettyref{cha:doi}.

\section{Contiki}
Contiki is an operating system designed for computers with severely constrained resources\cite{dunkels04contiki}. At the time of its original release in 2004 it was targeted at 8-bit micro controllers, ROM on the order of 100 kB and RAM less than 20 kB\citep[1]{dunkels04contiki}. Although the production costs of electronics certainly will continue to fall in future, this doesn't necessarily translate into a lesser interest in resource constrained operating systems such as Contiki - the lower prices can be used to produce more units instead of making existing devices more powerful. The choice of small devices such as the traditional 8- and 16-bit micro-controllers that has been the mainstay of Contiki since its inception\footnote{Examples of micro-controllers commonly used with Contiki are Texas Instrument's MSP430 architecture and Atmel's AVR 8-bit dito.}, is not just about cost, but also about power efficiency. Small chips have been, for various reasons, more energy efficient on a per cycle basis than heavier systems (e.g. the 32-bit  Cortex-M3 platform from the ARM Corporation). Having said that, this is set to change as the more powerful micro-controllers are becoming increasingly energy-efficient, a fact which we will address in the \prettyref{cha:fw}.

Having stated this, Contiki's greatest benefit is not that it's very compact, it's that it provides `a rich enough execution environment while staying within the limitations of the constrained devices'\citep[Introduction]{dunkels04contiki}. The `rich execution environment' is a reference to Contiki's capability to dynamically load and unload software, its multithreading, mesh networking\cite{tsiftes10rpl} and more, that are all designed to fit within the constraints, memory- as well as energy-wise (i.e. limit the number of execution cycles and keep peripherals such as the radio asleep). We will now review the most important of these features that makes Contiki a popular OS for IoT-devices.

\subsection{Multitasking}
Multitasking (concurrency) is provided in Contiki by the \emph{Protothreads} mechanism\cite{dunkels2005protothreads}. Before explaining its inner workings, I will provide the reader with a short review of the problems associated with multitasking in resource constrained systems.

The motivation underlying protothreads is to provide the programmer with multitasking that is easy to use, easy to understand and low in resource consumption. Multitasking has traditionally been implemented in virtually all operating systems by the means of \emph{processes}. In such a model, each \emph{process} is associated with an executable, has its own private stack and memory, set of registers (etc) and can be interrupted (more specifically, \emph{preempted}), at any time by the operating system's \emph{scheduler} in order to run a kernel specific task or to \emph{schedule} another task. In all cases where a process is preempted, a \emph{context switch} has to take place where much of the CPU's registers are changed, caches flushed etc. This is unsuitable for constrained environments due to the massive memory overhead of a process structure, private stacks and the energy required for doing a context switch.

One approach to overcome these drawbacks while still allowing some form of multitasking was employed by another sensor network OS: TinyOS\cite{levis2005tinyos}. TinyOS allowed the programmer to achieve multitasking by implementing their programs as event driven state machines. The machines has no stack and can only keep state (i.e. data) that are implicitly declared as such. As the C programming language doesn't have any event primitives, an extension to C was developed and named \emph{nesC}\cite{gay2003nesc}.

Contiki took a different route and provided the programmer with a model that resembled the sequential programming style (which is believed to be more comfortable for the majority of developers)\footnote{I found this reasoning to have merit after having participated in a course where application programming for TinyOS as well as Contiki was taught, having observed that the vast majority of his classmates preferred Contiki's Protothreads to TinyOS' nesC.}, but still benefitted from the efficiency of the event driven state machine.

\begin{figure}[h!]
   \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{dunkels-protothreads-example}
   \caption{Example code for a radio transmission program utilizing Protothreads. From \citep[p.7]{dunkels2005protothreads}. FIX: Check copyright!}
   \label{fig:ptexample}
\end{figure}

In figure \vref{fig:ptexample} a code example using Protothreads is shown, in which a radio is awaken at a set schedule to wait for check for transmissions. Protothreads uses a concept called \emph{conditional blocking} which can be explained in the following way: the execution can't leave the thread until a conditional blocking statement is reached (macros prefixed with `PT'). This can also be referred to as \emph{cooperative multitasking} as control can only leave a program when it voluntarily relinquish it.

As all Protothreads share the same stack and Contiki only needs to remember at which conditional to resume the thread, memory requirements can be as small as 2 bytes of RAM per thread. Furthermore, curiously enough, the `context-switching' mechanism can be wholly implemented using only the C switch control structure. This `quirk' of the C language was probably first discovered by Tom Duff\citep[p.10]{dunkels2005protothreads}\cite{wiki:duffs}.

%Programs written for an event-driven model typically have to be implemented as ex- plicit state machines. In contrast, with protothreads programs can be written in a se- quential fashion without having to design explicit state machines. To illustrate this, we return to the radio sleep cycle example from the previous section.

%\paragraph{Hardware support}

\subsection{IP networking}
UDP, TCP as well as ICMP over IPv4 and IPv6 are provided by the $\mu$IP stack, described in\cite{dunkels2003full}. The system is surprisingly robust given that its footprint amounts to only ~10 kB of ROM and a couple of hundred bytes of RAM: it fulfills all necessary host-to-host requirements stipulated in the relevant RFC documents\citep[p.4]{dunkels2003full} (e.g. flow and congestion control). The number of TCP connections and the size of the transmission / reception buffers are only limited by available RAM.

\begin{figure}

   \begin{minipage}{.5\textwidth}

      \includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{dunkels-uip-main_loop}

      \label{fig:uip-features}
   \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

One important reason as to why $\mu$IP can achieve such a low memory footprint is that is liberates the OS from the complicated transmission of data between application and IP stack. Most of the requirements associated with this interface, as described in the RFC, are waived in \citep[p.4]{dunkels2003full}. This not only removes the need for a lot of software logic, but also allows a drastic simplification of transmission buffer management, something which its designer have used to the fullest extent: there is only enough buffer space for one packet at any time, including the need of transmissions as well as receptions. Figure \ref{fig:uip-ml} describes the main loop of $\mu$IP which explains its buffer management. The application that wish to transmit data copies it into $\mu$IP's buffer and then calls the transmission function with the appropriate addressing information. Upon reception, the procedure is the opposite. The stack figures out which application is interested in the arrived piece of data, then calls its handler, which in turn is programmed to react on the data and to produce a reply, which in turn is written to the very same buffer and so on.

Even though an IP packet can be well over a kilobyte in size (the MTU\footnote{Maximum Transmission Unit: The largest size of a packet that a network or a host can handle.} of IPv6 is 1280 bytes), the buffer can still be much smaller than this if used in conjunction with a MAC\footnote{Medium ACcess} layer that has a small MTU (6lowPAN (using IEEE 802.15.4 in turn) is very popular for Contiki and has a MAC MTU of at most 102 bytes\citep[section 4]{rfc4944}). This will allow the incoming IP-packet fragments to be spoon-fed to the receiving application, negating the need for a large buffer for transmission purposes. Buffer size then becomes a problem of how large IP-packets one wants the applications to transmit.

\section{Internet Security}
\paragraph{Security on the Internet} was, and is, as of today an unresolved issue in my opinion. As its protocol, IP, was originally designed and developed in the open world of academic computer science, no security considerations were made. Instead, the three properties of information security (confidentiality, authenticity, integrity) \citep[section 8.1]{vasseur10interconnecting} were provided by physically protecting the network hardware and the imposition of social norms among its users and operators. As the Internet grew, this and other weaknesses started to become problems. In 1995, the IETF\footnote{The Internet Engineering Task Force is the governing body of the development of Internet standards.} released a number of documents starting with RFC\footnote{RFC, or Request For Comment, is the collective name of the IETF's standards} 1883\cite{rfc1883} that defined IPv6, the planned successor of IPv4. IPsec was developed in conjunction with IPv6 and was until the advent of RFC 6434\cite{rfc6434} in late 2011 a mandatory part of a compliant IPv6 host. However, adaption of IPv6 has been slow despite growing technical problems with the still incumbent IPv4. The resistance to upgrade is widely attributed to the fact that the cost and risk (software adaption, operator training, equipment replacement etc) of making the change in most networks outweighs the potential benefits. This equation will certainly change, if slowly, in the coming years. In the meantime, IPv6 has found to be a great boon to new networks like Internet-connected smart phones, Internet-enabled set top TV-boxes and, naturally, the Internet of Things. In these cases it can be argued that the cost of adopting the legacy IPv4 is roughly the same as that of adopting IPv6, while enjoying benefits of the latter's simplicity, auto configuration features and more\footnote{See chapter 15.1 in \cite{vasseur10interconnecting} for a brief discussion about the benefits of IPv6 over IPv4 in the context of IoT.}.

\paragraph{IPsec is a suite of protocols} that secures IP packets in an end-to-end fashion. Flows of packets, distinguished by properties such as source and target address, transport layer protocol, etc can be defined and different security policies applied. The system is not only limited to \emph{host-to-host} packet flows, but also allows a host to act as a gateway (termed \emph{security gateway} in the IPsec standard), enabling a secure link between two networks (\emph{network-to-network}) or a network to a host (\emph{network-to-host}). The suite can be implemented either directly in the IP stack of a host, but may also be located between the link layer and the network layer\citep[section 3.3]{rfc4301}, facilitating retrofits of existing stacks.

\begin{figure}[h!]
   \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{ipsec-flow}
   \caption{IPsec processing of IP-packets. From \citep[p.8]{rfc4301}.}
   \label{fig:ipsec-flow}
\end{figure}

\label{ipsec_proc}
\paragraph{In the IPsec processing model} IP-packets are said to be passed between from \emph{protected} to \emph{unprotected} interfaces and vice versa. In the usual case, such as above, there are only one of each. The unprotected interface is always the interface connected to the insecure network, while the protected may be either connected to a secure network (the \emph{security gateway} configuration) or be attached to an operating system's IP stack (FIX: Is the last statement ok?). The flow of packets between the protected and unprotected interfaces are determined by policies set by the system administrator which are expressed in terms of network- and transport-layer primitives, i.e. IP addresses, port numbers and transport-layer protocols. The policy can cause a packet to be: thrown away (\emph{DISCARD}); forwarded over the IPsec boundary without any action taken (\emph{BYPASS}; removing or applying cryptographic protection of the packet (\emph{PROTECT}). The latter is performed in the module named \emph{AH/ESP} in the fig. no. \ref{fig:ipsec-flow} which we will discuss in length further on (FIX: NO ref to place of disc.?).

\paragraph{IPsec affords protection for the traffic passed between networks as well as that between individual hosts.} In the former case, two IP networks are linked to each other by an IP-tunnel\footnote{An IP-tunnel allows communication between two IP-networks that don't have a routing path between each other. As the packets are transported by means of encapsulation (one IP-packets is transported in the payload field of another), other protocols can be `tunneled'  as well.} with an IPsec host at either end, acting as \emph{Security Gateways}. Packets that are routed to the other host's network are encapsulated in a security container (so called AH and ESP headers, which we will explain in \prettyref{sec:bgah} and \prettyref{sec:bgesp}) and dispatched to the Security Gateway at the other end of the tunnel. This allows secure communication between two networks and is useful when their hosts are not configured for IPsec. This mode of operation is referred to as \emph{tunnel mode} in the standards documents.

Although tunnel mode is by far the most popular usage of IPsec, this thesis will not implement it as it becomes less relevant in an IoT environment, for a variety of reasons described in \prettyref{cha:doi}. Instead, the research will focus on the so called transport mode\footnote{Transport mode as in transport layer mode} where no encapsulation takes place.

\paragraph{A central concept} of the IPsec model is the data structure named the \emph{Security Association} (SA). A Security Association defines a single simplex IP link and the security services it provides to the traffic that it carries. The services can be implemented by one of the two IPsec protocols: \emph{Authentication Header} (AH) and \emph{Encapsulating Security Payload} ESP. Bi-directional (duplex) traffic is enabled by creating a pair of SAs, one for each direction. As I will show, the SA is used by almost all IPsec components and we will return to it from time to time.

\paragraph{The policies and cryptographic secrets} used in IPsec processing are stored in three databases: the Security Association Database (\emph{SAD}); the Security Policy Database (\emph{SPD}) and its caches; the Peer Authorization Database (\emph{PAD}). The standard stresses the fact that the implementation of these databases should not be viewed as pre-requisites for a compliant IPsec implementation, but that such a system should exhibit the very same behavior as that of a system whose architecture was implemented in line with the standard's model. In the following paragraphs these databases will be used as constructs to explain the inner workings of IPsec, although, as the reader will learn in the \prettyref{cha:doi}, I have actually used these constructs in the final implementation as well. Finally, the system will be explained only in brief as the IPsec suite is simply too large for a thorough review in this thesis. The interested reader is advised to read the complete standard document\citep{rfc4301} starting at section 4.4 for an in-depth definition of the SAD, SPD and PAD.


\paragraph{The SPD} stores the policies that controls IPsec processing. It consists of an ordered list, where each entry is composed of a set of \emph{selectors}, \emph{PFP flags} and a \emph{processing action}. 

The \emph{selector} is a data structure that represents a traffic pattern between hosts or networks and serves to distinguish what traffic the policy in question is referring to. The fields are as follows: Local address; Remote address; Next Layer Protocol (e.g. TCP, UDP, ICMP); Local Port (This is dependent upon protocol type, e.g. in the case of an ICMP packet message type and code is listed instead.); Remote Port. Full specifications are found in \citep[Section 4.4.1.1]{rfc4301}.

PFP, or \emph{Populate From Packet} flags, are rules used in conjunction with the instantiation of an SA on the basis of the SPD entry. Instantiation in this context means that the newly created SA's selector (which has a similar purpose to a SPD entry's selector) is completed with information from that of the SPD entry's selector. However, for each of the selector's fields there is a corresponding PFP flag. If that flag is set, that field will be populated with information from the packet that triggered the instantiation. This process will be explained in detail further on as it's a central mechanism.

The \emph{processing actions} are the very same as described in \ref{ipsec_proc}: \emph{DISCARD}; \emph{BYPASS}; \emph{PROTECT}. The action \emph{PROTECT} differs from the the other actions in the sense that is also includes settings of how to protect the traffic, e.g. using a security gateway (tunneling), DSCP\footnote{Differentiated Services Code Point; QoS for IPv6} services, various SA settings used in instantiation.

\paragraph{The SPD's caches} can be divided into three different sections: SPD-O outbound traffic that is not to be protected; SPD-S for outbound traffic that is to be protected; SPD-I for all incoming traffic. The entries contains the same fields as the SPD, with the exception of the PFP (`Populate From Packet', as described above) field which is not present. From a functional point of view, each entry is an \emph{instantiation} of an SPD entry. That implies that each entry's selector is a subset of one of the SPD's entry's selectors. The IPsec processing mechanism creates such entries in response to encountering traffic that uses one of the SPD's entries. This is made because of two reasons: 

\begin{quotation}
1) Lookups in the SPD can be slow on large systems with many SPD entries. The SPD cache is faster\footnote{As to the question of why the SPD's cache allows a faster lookup, I have to direct the reader to RFC 4301. This speedup is hardly relevant to the thesis in question and thus the curious reader is encouraged to start reading at section 5, taking extra care to read the parts about de-correlation.}.
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
2) a rule in the SPD can order traffic for a large address space to be protected. That address-space can contain many hosts, and each host can in turn demand different SAs for different traffic (e.g. different SAs for traffic over TCP and UDP). Thus, one realizes that each SA must explicitly define what traffic it carries. This is one of the purposes of the SPD-S cache. Each entry corresponds to an SA and its selector defines its traffic.
\end{quotation}

It's unfortunately hard to get a good overview of the SPD's caching system as the information is sprinkled over large parts of RFC 4301. I recommend the curious reader to begin reading at section 5, `IP traffic processing'\citep[Section 5]{rfc4301}.



% SPD-S outbound prot. traffic: Selectors and more goes here for instansiated SAs
% SPD-O outbound nonprot. traffic: fast lookups
% SPD-I inbound nonprot traffic: fast lookups

%There is nominally one cache per SPD.

% The IPsec implementation context determines how selectors are used. For example, a native host implementation typically makes use of a socket interface. When a new connection is established, the SPD can be consulted and an SA bound to the socket. Thus, traffic sent via that socket need not result in additional lookups to the SPD (SPD-O and SPD-S) cache. In contrast, a BITS, BITW, or security gateway implementation needs to look at each packet and perform an SPD-O/SPD-S cache lookup based on the selectors.

\paragraph{The SAD} stores the IPsec system's \emph{Security Associations} (SAs). The purpose of the database is to store the parameters of the system's SAs, but can be used to store other information as well. RFC 4301 outlines in section 4.4.2.1 fifteen required fields and because of space constraints, this section will only list the ones that I deem most important.

Security Parameter Index (SPI): Each SA is identified by a 32-bit value. This value is selected by the receiving end of an SA to be unique. This makes it possible for a system to uniquely associate inbound traffic with an SA using the SPI number as the key. Outbound traffic processing uses the SPI number to construct the IPsec headers.

Sequence Number Counter: Every IPsec system maintains a counter for each SA that is incremented by one for each packet that it carries. This information is used in IPsec packet processing and anti-replay protection (as will be explained below.)

Anti-Replay Window: A counter and a bit-map used for detecting packets that have been replayed by an attacker\footnote{In a replay attack, a packet is intercepted by a man-in-the-middle with the purpose of delaying or repeating it. This can trick the targeted system into revealing secret information e.g. reusing the same keys in a stream cipher.}. The anti-reply protection is available for the AH as well as the ESP security protocols, but only when using automatic key management (more on this later).

Symmetric encryption information: Encryption algorithm and IPsec protocol type (AH or ESP) used by the SA along with necessary secrets (keys etc) and parameters.

SA Lifetime: A limit at which the SA should be terminated, expressed in either time or the number of bytes transported by the SA.

%each containing the parameters of , each consisting of the following substructures: a \emph{selector}, and an \emph{action}.


\paragraph{The PAD} (section 4.4.3) is controlled by the administrator and used by the security association management protocol along with the SPD to negotiate new SAs. The core purpose of the database is to store 1) the identification tokens of the peers that the system is allowed to communicate with and 2) the authentication mechanism, parameters and data of each aforementioned peer.

\section{Understanding the IP headers} are key to understanding IPsec. I will therefore quickly review the structure of the IPv6 headers before moving on to explain their relationship to IPsec. Below the readers finds a schematic of the IPv6 header, also called the IPv6 `fixed header' for reasons that soon are to be discussed.

\begin{figure}[here]
   \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{wiki-ipv6-header}
   \caption{The IPv6 header. Figure from \cite{wiki:ipv6_packet}.}
   \label{fig:ipv6_packet}
\end{figure}

I assume that the reader is acquainted with the general principles of IP networking, the discussion of the above header fields will be brief. \emph{Version} is always six; \emph{Traffic Class} (reminiscent of the IPv4 \emph{TOS} field) and \emph{Flow Label} are for flow and congestion control, which are of no concern to us; \emph{Payload Length} is the length of the payload field, including any so called `extension header' (more on this soon); \emph{Next Header} specifies the packet's transport layer protocol, or the first extension header's type if one is present; \emph{Hop Limit} is equivalent to IPv4's Time-To-Live field which is decremented by each router along its path, ultimately to be discarded when it reaches zero.

IPv4 placed all of its settings into one big header, many settings which as of today are rarely used, and the possibility of extending it with new features are severely limited. The designers of IPv6 solved this problem by keeping the fixed header (figure \ref{fig:ipv6_packet}) small and allowing it to be extended by a mechanism called \emph{extension headers}. The extension headers contain any optional information, information which can be intended for the packet's destination host and/or intermediate routers along its path. Although the information is usually supplied by the source host, some headers (such as \emph{Fragment}) can be altered and/or added by routers.

\begin{figure}[here]
   \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{ipv6-nextheader}
   \caption{Illustration of IPv6's next header scheme. FIX! Not received permission! Source:http://www.zytrax.com/tech/protocols/ipv6.html}

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[here]
   \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{wiki-ipv6-nextheader}
   \caption{The generic mandatory part of an `extension header'. Figure from \cite{wiki:ipv6_packet}.}
   \label{fig:wiki-ipv6-nextheader}
\end{figure}

The extension header scheme is basically a linked list (figure \ref{fig:wiki-ipv6-nextheader}). The field \emph{Next Header} denotes the type of extension header to come or, if this is the last extension header, the packet's type of transport layer; \emph{Hdr Ext Len} is the length of this extension header in multiples of eight octets, not including the first eight octets. The rest of the next header contains data that is specific to each next header type.

\begin{figure}[h!]
   \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{wiki-ipv6-listofextensionheaders}
   \caption{This list covers a number of common extensions headers `next header'. List from \cite{wiki:ipv6_packet}.}
   \label{fig:wiki-ipv6-listofextensionheaders}
\end{figure}


\section{The AH protocol in IPv6}
\label{sec:bgah}

\begin{figure}[h!]
   % \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{wiki-ipsec-ah}
   % \caption{The AH extension header. From \cite{wiki:ah_header}.}

   \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{ah_nextheader}
   \caption{The AH extension header. From \cite{rfc4302}.}
   \label{fig:wiki-ipsec-ah}

\end{figure}

The AH protocol's header (\emph{Authentication Header}) described in RFC 4302\cite{rfc4302} guarantees the \emph{data integrity} and the \emph{data authentication} (origin) of the IP packet which it is applied to. This is achieved by applying a \emph{Message Authentication Code} (MAC) to the packet's content and to the header's immutable fields using a key privy to the two parties.

\begin{figure}[h!]
   \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth, trim=0 205 0 210]{wiki-mac}
   \caption{Message Authentication Code. From \cite{wiki:mac}.}
   \label{fig:wiki-mac}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:wiki-mac} describes the principles of a MAC algorithm: The message, composed of the packet's payload and its immutable fields, are combined and digested\footnote{A synonym of \emph{digested} is \emph{hashed}.} along with a key. This produces a \emph{MAC} string (also referred to as a \emph{digest} or \emph{hash} string) which is attached along with the message. IPsec refers to this value as the \emph{ICV}.

Upon arrival the receiver performs the same calculations and compares the resulting \emph{MAC} with that included in the packet. This scheme will, if correctly implemented and algorithms chosen with care, make it computational infeasible\footnote{A security attack is said to be `Computationally Infeasible' if the required cost of performing the necessary cryptographic computations are outside the reach of even very large organizations.} for an attacker to alter the message without knowledge of the key. As a side benefit, the packet is also protected against accidental corruption such as transmission errors.

The parameters of the process (such as key, key length and type of MAC algorithm) are SA-specific and are stored in its data structure.




\section{The ESP protocol in IPv6}
\label{sec:bgesp}

\begin{figure}[h!]
   % \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{wiki-ipsec-ah}
   % \caption{The AH extension header. From \cite{wiki:ah_header}.}

   \caption{The ESP IPv6 extension header. From \cite{rfc4303}.}
   \label{fig:wiki-ipsec-esp}
\end{figure}

The ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload) protocol described in RFC 4303\cite{rfc4303}, provides \emph{confidentiality} and limited \emph{traffic flow confidentiality} in addition to AH's \emph{data integrity} and \emph{data authentication}. The term \emph{Encapsulating} is derived from the fact that the protocol is designed to encase everything that follows it in the packet (extension headers as well as payload). This practice is of benefit in itself, but rather it facilitates the implementation of confidentiality protection. For example, there are many popular algorithms which belongs to the block cipher family e.g. AES-CBC. Such algorithms only operates upon fixed sizes of data and therefore needs to pad\footnote{To `pad' data is to prepend or append white space characters (in the case of text documents) or null bytes to a string in order to increase it to a predetermined length.} the IP packet's payload to a multiple of the block length.

The fact that confidentiality protection is optional makes ESP services identical to that of AH's, but only under certain circumstances. In \prettyref{cha:doi} it will be shown how this fact can be exploited.

\section{Automatic key management (IKEv2)}%{Automatic negotiation of SAs (IKEv2)}
We have now explained the essentials of IPsec: the databases and their relations to each other and how they govern the flow of packets in the IPsec stack. This functionality is all that is required for an interoperable IPsec implementation. However, this requires all SAs to be set by the administrators of the systems in question. I.e. if two such hosts wants to communicate by IPsec the administrators must agree upon, and manually create, the SAs along with their encryption keys and associated settings. Naturally, we would like to automate this in order to lessen the human's workload. This is the purpose of an IPsec Key Management Protocol. At of the time of this document's writing, there are several protocols: IKE (defined in RFC 2407 - 2409)\cite{rfc2407}\cite{rfc2408}\cite{rfc2409}; IKEv2 (RFC 5996)\cite{rfc5996}; KINK (RFC 4330)\cite{rfc4330} and IPSECKEY (RFC 4025)\cite{rfc4025}. What they all have in common is that they solve the problem of automated key management, albeit in different ways, and that they all interface with IPsec through its databases.

However, this thesis will henceforth only discuss IKEv2 as it's the de-facto standard and, more importantly, the original target of study for this thesis. IKEv2 is the successor to IKE that was widely regarded to be a standard that suffered from unnecessarily complicated and vague standards documents. This issues were addressed in IKEv2 and resulted in, most importantly: better interoperability among implementations; faster keying handshake; less complex codebase.

\subsection{Overview}
As previously stated, IKEv2 is a component that is wholly external to the parts that we have covered so far (IPsec packet processing, SPD, SAD etc). The former are usually, in a general purpose operating system, implemented in the kernel\footnote{Linux's current IPsec implementation follows this model, and I believe that Microsoft's equivalent for Windows does so as well.} while the latter is written as service running in user space. This is the preferred method on an IPsec host as IPsec's packet processing mechanism needs to be implemented in conjunction with the OS' network stack (referred to as `bump-in-the-stack' or `native' in RFC 4301\citep[p.10-11]{rfc4301}) while IKEv2 is shaped into a user-space service. Naturally, we want as much code as possible to run in user space as it facilitates development and allows better integration with the rest of the operating system.

\subsection{Negotiating SAs}
IKEv2 communicates with other IKEv2 capable hosts by means of UDP datagrams on port 500. As the purpose of the communication is to negotiate new SAs, the communication can not be protected by any IPsec SAs. Therefore, a correctly configured IPsec host must allow non-protected traffic on this UDP port. In this section we will explain how IKEv2 itself creates a secure communication channel for its datagrams. This begins with the following exchange of data, as described in IKEv2 standards document, RFC 5996\citep[p.5]{rfc5996}:  


\begin{quotation}
All IKE communications consist of pairs of messages: a request and a response. The pair is called an `exchange', and is sometimes called a `request/response pair'. The first exchange of messages establishing an IKE SA are called the IKE\_SA\_INIT and IKE\_AUTH exchanges; subsequent IKE exchanges are called the CREATE\_CHILD\_SA or INFORMATIONAL exchanges. In the common case, there is a single IKE\_SA\_INIT exchange and a single IKE\_AUTH exchange (a total of four messages) to establish the IKE SA and the first Child SA. In exceptional cases, there may be more than one of each of these exchanges. In all cases, before any other exchange all IKE\_SA\_INIT exchanges MUST complete type, then all IKE\_AUTH exchanges MUST complete, and following that, any number of CREATE\_CHILD\_SA and INFORMATIONAL exchanges may occur in any order. In some scenarios, only a single Child SA is needed between the IPsec endpoints, and therefore there would be no additional exchanges. Subsequent exchanges MAY be used to establish additional Child SAs between the same authenticated pair of endpoints and to perform housekeeping functions.
\end{quotation}

The `IKE SA' referred to in the above text is an type of SA that is only for IKE communication. It is not used by the IPsec processing system, but only by the IKE service to secure its communication with other hosts. The creation of the `Child SA' is the final goal of the IKE connection - an SA to be used by the IPsec system to protect some part of the host's traffic. Its name can be derived from the fact that its cryptographic material is based upon that of the IKE SA's i.e. it can be said to be a descendent. On the next page (no. 6), the standard continues by providing more details about the SA negotiation:

\begin{quotation}
The first exchange of an IKE session, IKE\_SA\_INIT, negotiates security parameters for the IKE SA, sends nonces, and sends Diffie- Hellman values. The second exchange, IKE\_AUTH, transmits identities, proves knowledge of the secrets corresponding to the two identities, and sets up an SA for the first (and often only) AH or ESP Child SA (unless there is failure setting up the AH or ESP Child SA, in which case the IKE SA is still established without the Child SA). The types of subsequent exchanges are CREATE\_CHILD\_SA (which creates a Child SA) and INFORMATIONAL (which deletes an SA, reports error conditions, or does other housekeeping). Every request requires a response. An INFORMATIONAL request with no payloads (other than the empty Encrypted payload required by the syntax) is commonly used as a check for liveness. These subsequent exchanges cannot be used until the initial exchanges have completed.
\end{quotation}

As UDP is an unreliable transport layer, IKEv2 includes a mechanism for retransmission:

\begin{quotation}
An IKE message flow always consists of a request followed by a response. It is the responsibility of the requester to ensure reliability. If the response is not received within a timeout interval, the requester needs to retransmit the request (or abandon the connection).
\end{quotation}

After the handshake is complete (i.e. the creation of the SA for the IPsec traffic), the IKE SA is retained for future use as this will negate the need to re-create it whenever child SAs shared with that particular host need to be created or destroyed.

% \subsection{Interfaces}

% 
% As stated earlier, IKEv2 communicates with IPsec by manipulating its databases. However, what has not been mentioned is that the IPsec processing system can signal IKEv2 as well. One such case is when the need for a new SA arises. Consider the following scenario:

%The same procedure occurs upon SA expiration: expiration of an SA in the SAD causes IPsec to signal IKEv2 that it needs to negotiate a new one.

\chapter{Design and Implementation}
\label{cha:doi}
Implementing Internet standards in Contiki is often a challenging task. The standards are written with the presumption of hosts with vastly more capable hardware, which requires the engineer to simplify parts of the standard, make generalizations, and omit other parts altogether. This might be difficult as it requires good knowledge of the standard in question as well as the behavior of other implementations. The synthesis of this knowledge allows her to save hardware resources by making shortcuts in her implementation, shortcuts which might very well violate the standard document, but still exhibit a behavior which allows communication with the rest of the Internet. This a good example of the very practical, experimental, approach that is typical of Contiki's development culture.

% How about illustrating the above with a quote from A's uIP-paper concerning RFC-compliance?

\section{Development process}
The original goal of this thesis was to develop a working IKEv2 implementation on top of of an existing IPsec implementation already developed for Contiki. Therefore the literature review started with the RFCs\footnote{Described in so the so called RFC (Request for Comments) publication managed by the IETF and the Internet Society} covering that standard, continuing with other documents as my understanding of the field grew. 

% Move RFC footnote to begin of thesis

I found the body of standard documents large, complex and the systems described therein rich in features. It was unclear what effects a removal or alteration of a behavior could have on the implementation. Therefore the following principle was decided upon:

\begin{quotation}
\emph{The guiding design principle of the implementation} is that is must be a subset of the standard and follow the described architecture as close as possible. Any deviation from this requires a thorough analysis of the security implications or the implementation will lose its greatest benefit - the security properties brought by the thoroughly vetted IPsec standard.
\end{quotation}

Obviously, a thorough investigation and rework of the standards' internals would have the possibility of resulting in a more efficient implementation, but such an endeavor would require an effort that certainly would be outside the bounds of this work. 

Simultaneously, I worked with Contiki's source code and documentation in order to figure out how to integrate IKEv2 and the IPsec system into Contiki, a feat easier said than done as Contiki is quite different from the typical multi-user multi-tasking operating system. Implementation then proceeded in a top-down fashion where the data structures were written first, APIs secondly and then finally the actual algorithms.

Contiki targets\footnote{A compiler is said to be \emph{targeting} a certain CPU's instruction set in the sense that it is configured to produce compatible binaries.} many different platforms, and two of them is Windows and Linux, i.e. the platform that the compiler is running on. This is called the \emph{native} target and is particular in the sense that Contiki (which is running as an ordinary process in the host's operating system) has access to the wast resources of the personal computer. Needless to say, this greatly facilitates debugging and was therefore used as the predominant build target during the development process. Peripherals such as sensors are emulated and network communication is achieved using a faked serial interface over a tunnel FIX:Look this up. 

\paragraph{During final development} the target was changed from \emph{native} to \emph{msp430} (a CPU commonly used in IoT platforms due to its energy efficiency) as the focus turned from functionality to memory and speed improvements. Benchmarking and tuning has to be performed on the correct platform as libraries, the platform's instruction set, and compiler optimization possibilities are target specific. Instead of using actual hardware\footnote{Using real hardware for testing purposes turned out to be a large problem as no readily available platform had the required memory capacity to store the binaries.} Contiki was executed on emulated hardware using Contiki's popular simulation environment - Cooja\cite{osterlind06crosslevel}. Apart from providing emulation, Cooja features a complete experimental sandbox which will be further described in the chapter Evaluation.

% STRUCTURE
% 1. Requirements (what part of the RFCs to embrace)
% 2. Implementation

% As the author only had a rudimentary knowledge (roughly comparable as that of system administrator) of IPsec / IKEv2, he decided to that the safest way.

\section{IPsec}
At the project's inception, there was already a rudimentary implementation of IPsec in place (described in \cite{raza12secure}). It had the ability to receive as well as transmit AH and ESP headers, but could only handle one set of security parameters, effectively limiting the host to one SA that was used for duplex traffic. This implementation served as a proof-of-concept of the basics of IPsec on Contiki, as well as an IPsec header compression scheme in the underlying MAC-layer. Having stated this, the lack of support for multiple SAs and the inability to negotiate new ones made it difficult to fit it into a real world network environment where communication patterns are subject to constant change and keys need to be renewed as they age and lose their security properties.

In this section, I will begin by describing the IPsec implementation's design specification, its rationale, and most importantly its RFC-compliance. It will then continue with a review of how the technical problems have been solved.


\section{IPsec Requirements}

%D Databases
I decided from early on to implement a subset of IPsec RFC 4301 and associated documents. This was done in order to comply with the \emph{design principle} as outlined earlier, but mostly so because the databases are good at what they do: the implementation can use the SAD to store the SAs; the processing mechanism can use the SPD for policy management etc. There are good reasons as to why theses entities were invented, and leaving them for something else would make the other parts of the system (i.e. IKEv2) harder to implement as the developer would be forced to invent new solutions for doing without these systems. That would increase the work burden.

\paragraph{Tunnel-mode will not be implemented} as I believe the need for such functionality will be small in IoT networks using IPv6. The reasoning behind this is twofold:

% No. 1
Firstly, the most common use cases of network-to-network connections are: The single host connecting to a distant network and its resources (e.g. the telecommuter's VPN connection); the branch office's network's router providing a secure route to the main office's network. I believe that the former cases are the principal usage scenarios of today and can't see any good use of tunneling in IoT hosts. However, there are many situations where an entire IoT network (e.g. ventilation system control) would benefit from a secure tunnel between itself and a friendly organization's network (e.g. the ventilation system's operators). If other network paths than the secure tunnel is disabled, the resulting network topography forms a simple and effective security solution. Having stated this, the secure tunneling code doesn't need to reside in the IoT hosts, but is most conveniently implemented in the network's border router. Secure communication between hosts can still be achieved with IPsec transport mode.

% No. 2
Secondly, I believe that a major reason as to the current preference of tunneling over transport mode is that the latter is incompatible with NAT if used in conjunction with TCP, which is almost always the case. Tunnel mode is presented as the solution in RFC 3715\cite[2.1.b)]{rfc3715}. However, since this implementation constrains itself to IPv6, this problem disappears as the need for NAT is projected to go away with the introduction of IPv6 networks\footnote{NAT is commonly used to deal with the lack of IPv4 address space by `hiding' several hosts behind one public IP. IPv6 is conjectured to resolve this bye virtue of its $2^{128}$ address space.}.

\paragraph{ESP} along with associated security transforms\footnote{`The replacement of the variables in an algebraic expression by their values in terms of another set of variables; a mapping of one space onto another or onto itself; a function that changes the position or direction of the axes of a coordinate system.'\cite{wiki:transforms}} are described in RFC 4303\cite{rfc4303} and RFC 4835\cite{rfc4835}\footnote{Labeled `Cryptographic Algorithm Implementation Requirements for Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and Authentication Header (AH)'}, respectively. I implemented basically all of the functionality labeled as \emph{MUST} in RFC 4303. This resulted in an implementation that basically covered all of the externally visible behavior as described in the RFC, with the exception of the omission of ESN (Extended Sequence Numbers) which were deemed unnecessary as a limit of $2^{32}$ packets for an SA are sufficient. All security features such as Sequence Number Verification\citep[3.4.3]{rfc4303} were implemented though in order to comply with section 5, Conformance Requirements\citep[section 5]{rfc4303}.

The document RFC 4835 is the IETF's recommendation as to what security transforms (integrity/authentication, encryption) an IPsec host should be able to handle. The absence of any particular transform is not a security problem per see, but it will lead to one if the hosts then reverts to a common, less secure, transform. In any case, the lack of commonality definitely hampers interoperability. The following algorithms were implemented: AES-XCBC-MAC-96\cite{rfc3566} (authentication / integrity); AES-CTR\cite{rfc3686} (encryption); AES-CBC with 128 bit key\cite{rfc3602} (encryption) (FIX: broken in unpack!); NULL\cite{rfc2410} (encryption). TripleDES-CBC\cite{rfc2451} and HMAC-SHA1-96\cite{rfc2404} are labeled as MUST in the standards document\cite{rfc4835}, but were left out as they (firstly) would be more expensive to implement memory-vise and (secondly) afforded equivalent or lesser security than that of the alternatives.

The lack of certain transforms are, however, a small problem as the implementation easily can be extended thanks to the modularity of the IPsec SA system, which is duplicated in this implementation.

\paragraph{The AH protocol and its associated extension header is not implemented} as it's made redundant by ESP in Contiki's $\mu$IP stack.

The difference between the ESP and AH header is commonly described as that ESP provides confidentiality in addition to the integrity and authentication provided by AH, but that AH provides protection for the IP packet's header and extension headers as well. This is true, but a closer examination reveals that AH's `extra protection' provides little value in the case of $\mu$IP as for the following reasons:

Firstly, most extension headers are exempted from AH's authentication/integrity control since they are designed to be altered by the hosts on the packet's path. For example, consider the \emph{Hop-by-Hop Options} or the \emph{Routing} extension headers. As a counter argument, it can be stated that some extension headers are private to the packet's endpoint, but this argument is void because such headers can be placed inside the ESP header's encapsulation. This practice is inferred by IPv6's standard document\citep[p.13]{rfc2460} which recommends the \emph{Destination Options} header to be placed inside the encapsulation afforded by the ESP header, thus protecting it.

Secondly, the authenticity of the source and destination addresses are important as they are used to match an incoming packet to a socket. E.g. manipulation (spoofing) might allow an attacker with low level authorization to gain access to a concurrent connection enjoying higher privileges. The AH header protects against such attacks, but only if no NAT is employed on the packet's path, in which case it cannot be used. Still, without AH, the IPsec processing directives for incoming packets protects against such attacks by virtue of the following step (p.62, RFC 4301):


\begin{quotation}
4.  Apply AH or ESP processing as specified, using the SAD entry
    selected in step 3a above. Then match the packet against the
    inbound selectors identified by the SAD entry to verify that the
    received packet is appropriate for the SA via which it was
    received.
\end{quotation}

This implies that the cryptographic key used in protecting the packet must match the packet's traffic pattern (i.e. source and destination address, upper layer protocol and, if applicable, port number). Having stated this, it should be noted that this reasoning only holds true when IPsec is not used for multi- or any-cast, something which $\mu$IP doesn't support as of today.

Finally, I perceive that I am not alone in questioning the need for AH, even when IPsec is employed in more complicated environments. Personal communication on the IETF's IPsec mailing gave rise to many voices that wanted to have it removed\footnote{Please see \url{http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ipsec/current/msg07184.html}}, but most importantly IETF changed the requirement level for AH from MUST to MAY with the introduction of RFC 4301. Another benefit of removing AH from $\mu$IP is the possibility of removing the IPsec protocol bit in the underlying 6lowPAN layer as described in \cite{raza2011securing}, thus freeing up allocated space in its header.

\section{IPsec Implementation}
IPsec is implemented as a part of the $\mu$IP stack. The ESP header of incoming packets are unpacked in the loop that handles IPv6 extension headers. Incoming packets are processed according to the directives described in section 5.2 of RFC 4301. This includes fetching the SA associated with the ESP header's SPI; asserting the packet's integrity; decrypting it and asserting that it's not a replay.

\lstset{language=c}
\begin{lstlisting}
while(1) {
 
  switch(*uip_next_hdr) {
     case UIP_PROTO_ESP:

    	  if ((sad_entry = sad_get_incoming_entry(esp_header->spi)) == NULL) {
    	    PRINTF(IPSEC "Dropping incoming protected packet because of missing SAD entry\n");
    	    goto drop;
    	  }

        /*+  -- REDACTED -- */

    	  // Assert integrity (if protected)
    	  if (sad_entry->sa.integ) {
    	    integ_data.type = sad_entry->sa.integ;
    	    integ_data.data = (uint8_t *) esp_header;
    	    integ_data.datalen = auth_data_len;
    	    integ_data.keymat = &sad_entry->sa.sk_a[0];
    	    integ_data.out = (uint8_t *) &encr_data.icv;          
    	    integ(&integ_data);
    	  }
    	
        /*+  -- REDACTED -- */

    	  // Confidentiality      	  
    	  encr_data.type = sad_entry->sa.encr;
    	  encr_data.keymat = &sad_entry->sa.sk_e[0];
    	  encr_data.keylen = sad_entry->sa.encr_keylen;
    	  encr_data.integ_data = (uint8_t *) esp_header;
    	  encr_data.encr_data = iv;
    	  encr_data.encr_datalen = auth_data_len - sizeof(struct uip_esp_header);
    	  encr_data.ip_next_hdr = uip_next_hdr; // Non-zero to indicate ESP header
    	  espsk_unpack(&encr_data);
    	  
    	  // Verify ICV
    	  if (memcmp((uint8_t *) esp_header + auth_data_len, &encr_data.icv, sizeof(encr_data.icv))) {
    	    PRINTF("IPsec: ICV mismatch, dropping packet.\n");
    	    goto drop;
    	  }
    	
    	  // Replay protection (dynamic SAs only!)
    	  if (SAD_ENTRY_IS_DYNAMIC(sad_entry) && sad_incoming_replay(sad_entry, uip_ntohl(esp_header->seqno))) {          
    	    PRINTF(IPSEC "Error: This packet is a replay\n");
    	    goto drop;
    	  }
\end{lstlisting}

Thanks to optimization, much of the code used for processing incoming and outgoing packets is shared. Note that the implementation simply drops outgoing packets that requires protection, but which have no appropriate SA. Such an SA will (hopefully) be created by the IKEv2 negotiaton that is triggered upon the packet's rejection. This policy removes the need for a resource-hogging queue of to-be-transmitted packets, and is permissible according to the standards\citep[p.53]{rfc4301}.

\begin{lstlisting}
// Protect packets that are sourced from us, not ones routed on the behalf of others
if(! uip_ds6_is_my_addr(&UIP_IP_BUF->srcipaddr)) {
  PRINTF(IPSEC "This outgoing packet is being forwarded. Bypassing IPsec stack.");
  goto bypass;
}

/*+  -- REDACTED -- */

// We use the SAD as an SPD-S cache (RFC 4301). Is there an SA entry that matches this traffic?
sad_entry_t *sad_entry = sad_get_outgoing_entry(&packet_tag);

// If not, assert that it's in accordance with the policy of this traffic. (RFC 4301, p. 53, part 3b.)
if (sad_entry == NULL) {
  spd_entry_t *spd_entry = spd_get_entry_by_addr(&packet_tag);

  switch (spd_entry->proc_action) {
    case SPD_ACTION_PROTECT:
    PRINTF(IPSEC "SPD: Outgoing packet targeted for PROTECT, but no SAD entry could be found." \
      " Dropping this packet and invoking the IKEv2 service for SA negotiation.\n");

    // This asynchronous call will be processed after uip_process() has finished
    ike_arg_packet_tag = packet_tag;
    process_post(&ike2_service, ike_negotiate_event, (void *) spd_entry);
        
    // RFC 4301 grants us the permission to drop the packet triggering an IKE handshake
    goto drop;
    
    case SPD_ACTION_BYPASS:
    PRINTF(IPSEC "SPD: Outgoing packet targeted for BYPASS\n");
    goto bypass;

    case SPD_ACTION_DISCARD:
    PRINTF(IPSEC "SPD: Outgoing packet targeted for DISCARD\n");
    goto drop;
  }
}
// We will now proceed to protect this packet with the SA in sad_entry

if (sad_entry->sa.proto == SA_PROTO_ESP) {
  /*+  -- REDACTED -- */

  if (!esp_header->seqno) {
    IPSECDBG_PRINTF(IPSEC "Error: Sequence number overflow. Removing SAD entry.\n");
    sad_remove_outgoing_entry(sad_entry);
    goto drop;
  }

  /*+  -- REDACTED -- */
  
  espsk_pack(&encr_data);
  
  /*+  -- REDACTED -- */
  
  integ(&integ_data);

\section{IKEv2 Requirements}
The prime requirements of the IKEv2 service is to negotiate, maintain and delete SAs shared with other hosts. All other requirements follows from this. In the remainder of this section I will outline the requirements and justify their rationale.

\paragraph{The IKEv2 protocol requires an IKEv2 peer to establish an \emph{IKE session}} with the host that it wish to establish one or more IPsec SAs with. This includes the cryptographic exchange that serves to protect the \emph{IKE session} as well as any future IPsec SA, as the later derives its keying material from it. Naturally, all features required for this handshake has to be supported and implemented in such a way that their security properties are not rendered void. Furthermore, the IKE service has to be able to accommodate multiple concurrent sessions as I believe it will offer flexibility for the applications running on the host (e.g. you, as an application developer, doesn't need to care about how many secure connections your application will open).

\paragraph{The exchange of cryptographic keys} is performed by means of a \emph{Diffie-Hellman} (DH) key exchange\footnote{The Diffie-Hellman key exchange is a scheme that is commonly used for exchanging keys over insecure channels (such as the Internet) in a secure fashion. Diffie-Hellman, and its successor, the RSA scheme, are widely used by Internet applications.}. This exchange is very hardware-intensive in regard to memory as well as calculations (and thus energy), as is typical of asymmetric encryption schemes. This has limited the use of such security mechanisms in IoT systems.

Briefly, the reason that asymmetric encryption is so resource intensive is that it's centered around operations on very large numbers. The operations are very simple (e.g. $A = g^{a} mod p$), but in the case of the popular RSA scheme, the numbers $a$ and $A$, which forms the so called public and private key, respectively, can be so large that they require 3072 bits to represent. A DH exchange with such a long key is most often not feasible in an IoT context.

The method used by RSA (and that is referred to in the example above) is a DH key exchange using certain qualities inherent to multiplicative groups of integers modulo $n$. A development of this idea, called \emph{Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)} allows a DH exchange using much smaller key sizes, without forsaking security. Considering only the DH exchange, ECC provides no technical drawbacks in comparison to RSA, but only benefits in terms hardware resources and energy. Because of this, IETF standardized several ECC parameters (ECP groups) for the use in the IKEv2 protocol (RFC 5114: Additional Diffie-Hellman Groups for Use with IETF Standards\cite{rfc5114}). I believe that the reason as to why ECC isn't already in widespread use is that 1) some parts of ECC is encumbered with patents 2) implementations of RSA are widespread and accepted as the standard solution to asymmetric encryption.

\begin{figure}[h!]
   \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{rfc5114-security}
   \caption{In section 4, `Security Considerations', of RFC 5114\cite{rfc5114} the authors argue that ECC keys can be made much shorter without sacrificing security. Each line is cross-reference of different encryption types and key lengths offering the same cryptographic security. Notably, the benefits of ECC becomes even greater as the level of security is increased.}
   \label{fig:eccbenefits}
\end{figure}

In order to evaluate the possibilities of ECC in a resource constrained host, I decided that the IKEv2 implementation should implement the DH key exchange by means of ECC, using one of the shorter groups as seen in \vref{fig:eccbenefits}.


\paragraph{IKEv2 supports several authentication methods:} public key signatures, shared secrets and the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)\cite{rfc3748}. As EAP is more complicated (i.e. higher complexity) than the other methods, I believe it's of no interest to this implementation and thus I will only focus on the former methods. Section 2.15 in RFC 5996 serves as a good introduction to the mechanisms used by the former methods (public key and shared secrets). What both schemes have in common is that they both perform a cryptographic operation on a string which is a concatenation of different IKEv2 messages and values shared by both parties\citep[p.48]{rfc5996}. (Please note that the formerly described DH key exchange only provides the hosts (peers) with a shared secret, not authentication. Thus, without any type of authentication, we're liable to a Man-In-The-Middle attack.)

The public key method (PKCS\#1) features the most flexibility and ease-of-use as it allows the peers to authenticate themselves using well known X.509 certificates, possibly using a public key infrastructure. Still, this method has not been implemented as it requires the implementation of digital signature algorithms\footnote{I had access to code that implemented digital signatures using Elliptic Curve Cryptography, but the work required to implement it with IKEv2 would have been far too large.}; handling the X.509 certificates and the associated payload and more. Not only would the required work effort be prohibitive, but the value of the work would be questionable as the extra asymmetric operation\footnote{We already perform one asymmetric operation during the DH key exchange} and the associated code itself would probably make it unpractical on current hardware.

Because of these aforementioned reasons, I have opted to implement the Shared Key authentication method as described in \citep[p.49]{rfc5996}. As it only requires the implementation of a simple pseudo-random hashing function (as described in section 2.13), the demands on ROM and CPU (and thus energy) are limited. The downside of this scheme is that it requires a string (the key) to be manually shared and maintained between the hosts that wishes to communicate. Although this gives rise an administrative hassle and arguably weaker security than the certificate alternative, it certainly affords security that's good enough for many situations.

% \paragraph{}
% As the purpose of this work is to demonstrate IKEv2 bla bla it has to be able to handle multiple sessions etc
% 
% The IKEv2 service is implemented as a Contiki Process.
% 
% The machine is built to be extended. The following is implemented as of now:
% 
%

% Easily extendable to allow for missing features and other keying schemes for other applications.

\section{IKEv2 Implementation}
The IKEv2 implementation supports several concurrent sessions, each modeled as a mealy state machine\footnote{In a mealy state machine the output is function of the current state as well the current input.} that persists as long as the IKE SA is alive. As I will show, this enables communication with multiple hosts without excessive memory consumption.

\begin{figure}[h!]
   \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{mealy_demo}
   \caption{IKEv2 service principle}
   \label{fig:mealydemo}
\end{figure}

As to begin the explanation, I would like to focus the readers thought on the fact that the peers exchange \emph{messages}. Each such \emph{message} is received by ike\_statem\_incoming\_data\_handler() which multiplexes the message on the basis of the session unique identifier in the IKE header (the IKE SA's SPI). Each such SPI is associated with an IKE session and a corresponding state machine which represents its state.

In the state machine, each \emph{state} is represented by a function that, on the basis of the message received from the other peer, makes a \emph{decision} of how to act, i.e. what message to send in reply. That message is created and transmitted by its associated \emph{transition}, which itself is implemented as a function which only takes the session structure's pointer as its argument. This is a powerful feature of the implementation because it allows a message to be retransmitted without resorting to buffers containing the last transmitted message. Instead, the transition's function (whose pointer resides in the session struct) is simply run again. This saves several hundred bytes of RAM which otherwise would be required for buffer space. As the reply is received, the corresponding state function (determined by the session's data structure), is called and the process repeats.

The data structures and associated mechanism of the previously mentioned machines are interesting, but because of space constraints, they will not be reprinted here. Instead, the curious reader is directed towards the source code and machine.c and machine.h.

Instead, the rest of this section will be devoted to the description of the implementation of the IKEv2 protocol's responder and initiator machine's. We'll begin the former.

\section{IoT}

SICS\footnote{Swedish Institute of Computer Science} have been conducting research the field of IoT for over a decade. The purpose is to explore, and try to solve, the problems in the software stack. One of these areas is end-to-end security between a host in the IoT network and one on the Internet.

 This has resulted in the very small event driven operating system Contiki. 

Why we want IoT.
In order to bring IoT out of the lab and into the society it needs to be secure. A pair of hosts in the network must be able to authenticate each other and protect their communication from privy eyes by means of encryption. The solution concerned also needs to be standards-compliant with the rest of the Internet.

This suggests that TLS or IPsec may be suitable.

TLS secures a TCP connection. IPsec secures everything from the network layer and up. The purpose of this work is to implement IPsec and IKEv2 

The topic of this work is to implement IPsec and IKEv2 with the purpose of investigating the following:


\subsection{The Contiki OS}%\footnote{Internet of Things}}

\subsection{IPsec}

\section{Scope}

The purpose of this thesis is to explore the IPsec venue; is it a feasible solution?

\subsection{Motivation}

The goal of the thesis is to write an implementation of IPsec and IKEv2 in order to prove that the following is possible:
* Low power, resource constrained hardware can utilize ``heavy'' Internet-standards and asymmetric encryption
* The implementation should be able to communicate with a wide range of systems

From this, the following should be required in order to form a valid proof-of-concept:
* The implementation should be polite towards other hosts. It should be able to handle a wide range of situations.
* Where time does not allow for a full implementation of a certain functionality, it should be clear that the implementation can be extended without significant rewrites of other parts.

The original scope was the implementation of the IKEv2 service as described in RFC 5996 [...] for the Contiki OS. After a more thourough investigation this was found not to be feasible.
