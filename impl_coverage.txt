IPsec
=================================
Major features implemented:
	Replay protection
	ESP
	Transport mode
	Traffic selectors (traffic multiplexing over SAs)
	SAD, with SA expiration mechanism
	SPD and related functions (incl. one SA offer for each SPD rule)
	Encryption
		ESP-NULL
		AES-CTR, varying key length (only 128 bit tested). Partial rewrite of Simon's code.
	Integrity
		AES-XCBC. Partial rewrite of Simon's code.
	
	
Major features not implemented:
	AH
	Tunnel mode
	Various integrity and encryption algorithms tagged as REQUIRED


IKEv2
=================================
Major features implemented:
	State machine for responder
	State machine for initiator
	ECC DH (only DH group 25)
	Authentication by means of pre-shared key
	Traffic selector negotiation (note: this is only a simplification of section 2.9's algorithm)
	SPD interface that allows multiple IKE SA offers
	SK payload: Encryption and integrity is the same as in IPsec (it's a common interface)
	Multiple concurrent sessions supported
	Multiple child SAs per IKE SA
	
Major features not implemented:
	Cookie handling (the code is there, but it's not tested)
	Only tunnel mode supported
	EAP
	No NAT support whatsoever, anywhere
	No IPcomp support
	Only IDs of type ID_RFC822_ADDR (e-mail address) are supported
	No support for Certificates as IDs, nor for authentication
	

Features that should be implemented in IKEv2, but haven't yet:
Deletion of Child and IKE SAs (Delete payload)
State machine Established can't create child SAs currently
